Tools for reduced-order modeling.

Currently just really basic data loading/processing and plotting with support for:

- 2d finite-volume quadrilateral mesh
- Tecplot ASCII data files
- 1d and 2d plots with slicing and animation
- Surface integrals on boundary

Some ideas for the future:

- More general abstract data loading/parsing/saving, can support Tecplot but also other common formats like vtk, pmd, yt, etc.
- Support for 1d and 3d mesh data
- Support for numerical results other than finite-volume (or even other than PDEs)
- Volume and line integrals
- Actual ROM implementations (lol)
