The API reference section of your documentation is a good place to include thorough, informational details on how to
use your code. A good way to do this is to include high-level diagrams on this page, and then have a separate page for
each core module of your package. This is completely automated by default via:

1. `gen-files` - This `mkdocs` plugin will create a documentation markdown page for each module/package within the
src/romtools folder.
1. `literate-nav` - This plugin will create a navigation structure under the `API reference` tab on your website that
matches the output of `gen-files` and therefore the structure of your source code.
1. `mkdocstrings` - This plugin will automatically pull all docstrings from your `.py` source code files and insert them
into your API reference pages.

All you need to do is write good docstrings in your source code! :thumbsup:
